# Arena-Mastery-Uploader
Arena-Mastery-Uploader is a plugin for [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker) to upload
your arena runs to [Arena Mastery](http://www.arenamastery.com/).

# Installation
- Download the ArenaMasteryUploader-vx.x.zip archive [here](https://github.com/fmoraes74/Arena-Mastery-Uploader/releases).
- Extract the archive to the subfolder `.\Plugins\ArenaMasteryUploader` of the Hearthstone Deck Tracker program folder.
- Enable the plugin at `Options > Tracker > Plugins`
- Set your Arena Mastery credentials in the plugin settings
- Make sure HDT is enabled to track arena rewards at `Options > Tracker > General > Show arena reward dialog`

# Running
- Start the plugin from the plugins menu
- Select the arena runs you want to upload (double check to make sure all games/rewards are properly recorded)
- Press the `Upload selected runs` button

# Notes

The deck is not uploaded to Arena Mastery yet because newer cards are still missing from the website and cause strange things when you try to use them. 
Once that is resolved, I will add code to upload the deck.
